## Introduction

I am a PhD student at the HKU in Hong Kong. I specialize in Real Estate Economics and Finance. My academic background in both Germany [European Business School, Schloss Reichartshausen] (www.ebs.edu) and Hong Kong [The University of Hong Kong] (http://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes_/rec/) lie in Real Estate Finance and Economics topics.
