My first time to Alicante. Overall an interesting city with a nice campus. At 40Â°C in July, I could have spent some more time at the beach though.

The most interesting session were the ones in my subfield, spatial analysis. Mostly, because it is hard to judge the novelty of an idea that does not directly relate to the specific subfield you regularly read literature in.

In my opinion, very interesting work were presented by   
- Sotirios Thanos (__Putting Time into Space: Spatial Hedonic Pricing Models and Temporal Coherence__) and  
-  Roel Helgers (__Housing Prices, Housing Stock Diversity and GIS-Data: How Should We Design Our Neighborhoods?__).
