This blog shall serve as a writing practice for getting "in the mood" of producing every day regularly. This will facilitate the last year of Phd in which I'll probably need to write quite a lot.

Additionally to just training my fingers and mind, I will blog about specific topics of interest in my research - most preferably in the categories econometrics, real estate investments and finance.
